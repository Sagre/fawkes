 * @fn bool SharedMemoryHeader::matches(void *memptr)
 * Method to check if the given memptr matches this header.
 * This method is called when searching for a shared memory segment to
 * open, list or erase it.
 * Implement this to distuinguish several shared memory segments that share
 * the same magic token.
 * @param memptr The memory chunk in the shared memory segment where to start
 * checking.
 * @return true, if the given data in the memory chunk matches this header, false
 * otherwise.
 *
 * @fn unsigned int SharedMemoryHeader::size()
 * Size of the header.

 * header. It must return the same size every time.
 * @return size of header
 *
 * @fn void SharedMemoryHeader::initialize(void *memptr)
 * Initialize the header.
 * This should initialize the header data in the given memptr from the
 * data of this SharedMemoryHeader derivate instance. It has to write out
 * all state information that is needed to identify the shared memory
 * segment later on.
 * @param memptr the memptr where the header data shall be written to.
 *
 * @fn void SharedMemoryHeader::set(void *memptr)
 * Set information from memptr.
 * Set the information stored in this SharedMemoryHeader derivate instance
 * from the data stored in the given memptr.
 * @param memptr The memptr where to copy data from.
 *
 * @fn void SharedMemoryHeader::reset()
 * Reset information previously set with set().
 * This shall restore the state the header had before set() was called. This is
 * used for instance in the SharedMemoryLister after info about one segment
 * has been printed.
 *
 * @fn size_t SharedMemoryHeader::data_size()
 * Return the size of the data.
 * The size of the data that will be stored in the shared memory segment.
 * This method has to return the same value everytime and may only depend
 * on the other data set in the header and written to the shared memory
 * segment.
 * @return the size of the data segment

 *
 * @fn bool SharedMemoryHeader::operator==(const SharedMemoryHeader &s) const
 * Check for equality of headers.
 * This shall be implemented that it compares the current and the given instances
 * for equality. You probably want to use dynamic_cast to cast the given instance
 * to a compatible type.
 * @param s shared memory header to compare to
 * @return true if the two instances identify the very same shared memory segments,

/** @class SharedMemory <utils/ipc/shm.h>
 * Shared memory segment.
 * This class gives access to shared memory segment to store arbitrary data.
 * With shared memory data can be shared between several applications. Special
 * means like semaphores have to be used to control access to the storage
 * to prevent data corruption.
 *
 * The shared memory segment is divided into three parts.
 * 1. General shared memory header
 * 2. Data-specific header
 * 3. Data
 *
 * The general header consists of a magic token of MagicTokenSize that is used
 * to find the basically compatible shared memory segments out of all existing
 * shared memory segments. This is done for convenience. Although in general
 * shared memory is accessed via keys or IDs it is easier from the maintenance
 * side to just scan the segments to find the correct one, especially if there
 * may be more than just one segment for the same application.
 * The header also includes a semaphore ID which is unused at the moment.
 *
 * The data-specific header is generated from a given SharedMemoryHeader
 * implementation. It can be used to store any information that is needed to
 * identify a specific shared memory segment and to store management data for
 * the data segment. It should always contain enough information to derive
 * the data segment size or if needed an explicit information about the memory
 * size.
 *
 * The data segment can be filled with any data you like.
 *
 * Shared memory segments are protected with a read-write lock implemented with
 * two IPC semaphores. The writer takes preference in locking. Only a limited
 * number of concurrent readers can be allowed. The constant
 * MaxNumberConcurrentReaders defines how many these are.
 * If a shared memory segment already has a semaphore assigned at the time it
 * is opened this semaphore is automatically opened. In any case add_semaphore()
 * can be used to create (or open if it already exists) a semaphore for the
 * shared memory segment. Information about the semaphore is stored in the
 * shared memory general header.
 *
 * This class provides utilities to list, erase and check existence of given
 * shared memory segments. For this often a SharedMemoryLister is used that
 * takes care of formatting the output of the specific information about the
 * shared memory segment.
